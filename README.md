# EEP1-Assembler

Wagwan my drillaz

Basically you gotta put your assembly in the text file named "assembly.txt" in the same format as the demo file.
Then run the code and the output will be written to machine.ram . After that you have to make a new ROM file in issie which replaces the old one.
When you are creating int hover over "Enter Data Later" and pick "machime.ram" or whatever you have the file saved as.
